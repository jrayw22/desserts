   <p> I love ice cream because it is such a delicious dessert! It is very refreshing to have on a hot day and there are SO MANY COOL FLAVORS TO CHOOSE FROM!! Ice cream is also very cool because there are many things that you can make with it such as sundaes, milkshakes, ice cream cake, and MORE!! </p>
